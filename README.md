This repository includes a convenient script called `present.sh` that renders and converts the presentation to HTML in one step.

1. Ensure the script has executable permissions:
   ```
   chmod +x present.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./present.sh
   ```

The script will render the presentation and open it in your default browser.

### Option 2: Manual Commands

If you prefer to manually run the commands, follow these steps:

1. **Render the Presentation**:
   ```
   manim-slides render presentation.py MerkleTreePresentation
   ```

2. **Convert and Open the Presentation**:
   ```
   manim-slides convert MerkleTreePresentation presentation.html --open
   ```

This will generate an `HTML` file and open it in your browser.

## üêç Installation

To build and run the project from scratch:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/merkle-tree-presentation.git
   cd merkle-tree-presentation
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
